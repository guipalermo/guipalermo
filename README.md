  Hi, I'm Guilherme! You are welcome to my repository page.

Developing since 2010. I started working with ASP classic and basic languages ​​like HTML, CSS and javascript. At the same time, in the technical class I studied JAVA, C and C++.

In 2013, I started working with Wordpress and Yii Framework. I used Wordpress tools to help build an e-learning platform. As for the Yii Framework, I used it to build a subscription club.

This subscription club had many integrations with external services such as payment gateways and transportation companies. We also built an internal management panel to control attendance and production. In this project we use jQuery and Bootstrap.

In 2015, I started a postgraduate course in mobile development, focusing on Games and IoT. I learned some tools and frameworks in Java and how to use some electrical components with Arduino.

At this point, I'm technical leader in the same subscription club. In recent years I have learned about AWS tools, new web languages ​​and some design patterns. We are building a new subscription club plattform using microservices (Laravel to backend and React Native/Vue.js to frontend).
